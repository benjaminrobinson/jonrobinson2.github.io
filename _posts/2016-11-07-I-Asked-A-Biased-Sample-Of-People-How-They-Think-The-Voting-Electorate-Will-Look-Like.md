title: I asked a biased sample of people what they think the electorate will look in 2016, here's what I learned.

"It all comes down to turnout" is a phrase uttered by countless analysts, pundits, and armchair elections quarterbacks alike. Over 4 days from September 30th to October 4th I surveyed the views of 400 non-random people a few questions about who they thought would vote in 2016 by pushing them to take a survey on the Survey Monkey platform. The goal here is not to ask a representative sample of individuals anything but hoping that the group of people interested in taking the survey have some insights into something that we won't really have a great understanding of until voter files update with turnout records or at least the Census reports on voter turnout come out in the coming months.

At this moment it is impossible to validate this analysis, but I still wanted to share the responses I received. I asked anonymous coworkers, family members, journalists, academics, fellow political professionals, and the truly heterogeneous Twitter responses I received from lawyers, doctors, and the like.

##The Data

#Question 1

First I asked broadly about turnout levels to expect in 2016, anchoring respondents to information about 2008 and 2012 to get a good handle on potential levels of turnout, in proper context.
