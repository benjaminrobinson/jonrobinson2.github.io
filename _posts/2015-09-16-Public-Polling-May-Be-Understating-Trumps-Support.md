title: Public Polling Actually Understates Trump's Support Among Republicans
---
Like many Jewish public opinion researchers, this weekend I found myself sitting at a Rosh Hashannah dinner talking with people about of all things, Donald Trump. Anticipating this I dug a bit into 'the Donald''s numbers from public polling in an attempt to gain some semblance of a nugget.

What I found was incredibly interesting.

Thanks to Mark Blumenthal, David Shor, and David Margolis for taking the time to hear me out when I found this.
